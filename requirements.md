# Enterprise Test Automation Framework for AUT (Salesforce)

## 1. Overview

The enterprise test automation framework is designed to provide a robust, scalable, and feature-rich solution for automated testing of the Salesforce application (AUT). The framework encompasses various features, including data-driven testing, logging, retry mechanism, self-healing, cross-browser testing, multiple environments, password encryption, code quality, CI/CD integration, reusable utilities, data generation, parallel testing, and API mocking/testing.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Page Object Model (POM) Implementation
- **Objective:** Apply POM Principle to structure the code and make reusable & maintainable code.

### 2.2 Data-Driven Testing
- **Objective:** Enhance test coverage by parameterizing tests with external data.

### 2.3 Logging
- **Objective:** Provide comprehensive logs for detailed test execution analysis.

### 2.4 Retry Mechanism
- **Objective:** Handle intermittent failures gracefully with automatic retries.

**2.5 Self-Healing**  
**Objective:** Adapt to dynamic changes in the Salesforce application to minimize maintenance efforts.

**2.6 Cross-Browser Testing**  
**Objective:** Validate application functionality across different browsers.

**2.7 Multiple Environments**  
**Objective:** Support testing in various environments (e.g., sandbox, developer edition, production).

**2.8 Password Encryption**  
**Objective:** Securely manage and use passwords in test scenarios.

**2.9 Code Quality**  
**Objective:** Enforce coding standards and maintain high-quality code.

**2.10 CI/CD Integration**  
- **Objective:** Seamlessly integrate the framework with CI/CD pipelines.

**2.11 Reusable Utilities**  
- **Objective:** Develop modular and reusable utilities to optimize code maintenance.

**2.12 Data Generation**  
- **Objective:** Generate test data dynamically to ensure diverse test scenarios.

**2.13 Parallel Testing**  
- **Objective:** Execute tests concurrently for faster feedback and optimized test suite execution.

**2.14 API Mocking/Testing**  
- **Objective:** Mock and test Salesforce APIs to validate backend functionality.

**3. Test Scenarios (Sample)**  

**3.1 Page Object Model Class and basic test**  
**Scenario:** Verify creation of Page class for login page and create basic test.  

**Steps:**  
1. Create POM Class for login page.  
2. Create Tests using Page class and its methods to login.  
   - Log in to Salesforce.  
   - Verify the success of login.  

**3.2 Data-Driven Testing**  
**Scenario:** Verify creation of Salesforce records using different sets of data.
